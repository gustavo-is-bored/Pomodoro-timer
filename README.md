initially made this using tkinter using some assets but it was horribly optimised and crashed before the first work session was done. So here it is working only in the terminal. can no longer interrupt the time to have a short/long break because of this which is a bit annoying. I may have another go with a different GUI at some point.

This probably doesn't strictly need to be 111 lines of code. But as long as you're not running it on a potato it works fine. So I dont care.

Also this is windows exclusive because it relies on the winsound package. Want to make a linux equivalent at some point
